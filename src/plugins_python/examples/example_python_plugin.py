"""
Minimal Python plugin example.

This plugin intentionally does not modify the print. It proves the full path:

1. SuperSlicer loads python_plugin_loader.dll from the plugin repository.
2. The loader imports this .py file.
3. This file returns a Python plugin object to the loader.
4. The loader registers a normal plugin_instance through the C ABI.
5. The host later calls setup()/run() through the loader-created vtable.

The example runs late in the pipeline and only reports progress once, so it is
safe to keep enabled while testing the loader.
